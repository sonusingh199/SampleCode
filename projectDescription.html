           <h3> <u> Project Description </u></h3>
           <br/>
           <p>* A 3 phase inverter is used to convert a DC i/p into an AC output. It includes three arms which are usually delayed through 120Â° of an angle to produce a 3 phase.

           </p>
           <p>*Working Principle of Three Phase Inverter: 
            The working principle of this inverter is that it consists of three inverter switches with a single phase. In which each switch can be connected to the load terminal. Three switches can be synchronized to the operation of the basic control system. So that a switch works to create a line / to-line output waveform, including six steps, at every 60 degrees of the basic output waveform.
            
            This wave involves a zero voltage stage between two sections like the positive and negative of a square wave. Once the carrier-based PWM technology is applied to this wave. The original shape of the wave can then be taken. So that the third harmonic including its multiplication will be canceled.
